# Book-Recommendations

Book Recommendations is a Python application meant for finding new books that the user would enjoy reading based on their ratings for
books they have read. Users enter a score of either -5, -3, 1, or 5 for each of the books they've read in the list (0 if they haven't read the book),
and then the program will see who they are most similar to based on those recommendations. The program will then recommend a book which the most similar
person rated highly that the user has not yet read.

## Features
- Quickly add or remove books from the list by editing books.txt
- Change the users in the database or their rankings by editing customers.txt
- Recommends new books the user has not yet read that they may be interested in

## Built with
- Python
